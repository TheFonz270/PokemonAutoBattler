Project Title: Pokemon Auto-Battler

Description: Desktop browser based game using the popular Pokemon franchise.

Why? Its a topic we are interested in and we think the end result could be both fun and a good showcase of our learning so far.

MVP Acceptance critera:

The player should be able to create an account and play a game of Pokemon which automatically completes with minimal player input.
There should be a tutorial that shows the player how to play.

Potential Extensions:

We have an entire document full of these. Highlights include music, implement flavour text, pokedex, etc.

Risks: Re-learning how to use React. Scope is large. Potentially too much for 3 people.

Exclusions: Not targeting mobile.
